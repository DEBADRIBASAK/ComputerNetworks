The first few lines in the previous code example are related to
namespaces (mentioned later in this chapter), which is a way to group
associated classes. The namespace keyword declares the namespace
with which your class should be associated. All code within the braces
that follow it is regarded as being within that namespace. The using
declaration specifies a namespace that the compiler should look at to
find any classes that are referenced in your code but arenâ€™t defined in
the current namespace. This serves the same purpose as the import
statement in Java and the using namespace statement in C++ (code file
HelloWorldApp/Program.cs ):
The standard System namespace is where the most commonly used
.NET types reside. It is important to realize that everything you do in
C# depends on .NET base classes. In this case, you are using the
Console class within the System namespace to write to the console
window. C# has no built-in keywords of its own for input or output; it
is completely reliant on the .NET classes.
Within the source code, a class called Program is declared. However,
because it has been placed in a namespace called Wrox.HelloWorldApp ,
the fully qualified name of this class is Wrox.HelloWorldApp.Program
(code file HelloWorldApp/Program.cs ):
